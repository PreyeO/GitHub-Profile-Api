#GITHUB PROFILE.

This is a task given to me by ALT SCHOOL AFRICA.

Here i fetched my github profile using github API and diaplayed.

I displayed the list of my repositories and also displayed some content in each repository clicked using nested routing.

I displayed a separate page called contact to text my errorboundary.

I attached a 404 page for wrong links.

I performed proper SEO, ERRORBOUNDARY, ACCESSIBILITY.

Overall, i enjoyed working in this task, i got to improve my knowledge on:
*Accessibility
*SEO
*useParams
*useContext.

Below is the deployment link.
